      <h1>Double Climbing</h1>
      <p class="platform">Platform: 💻</p>

      <p>
        Double Climbing is a simple game in which you have to climb a wall<br><br>
        But as a twist, you don't control only one character, you have to climb with
        2! Progressing on the wall, by jumping from rock to rock, using the elastic rope that links the two of you together.<br><br>
        Try to get as high as you can, while avoiding hazard along the way!<br><br>
        You can play with either the mouse or a controller, controller is recommended, but some may have issues.
      </p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>You start at the bottom, and you have to slowly get up, you need to launch each character to a rock to slowly climb to wall, while avoiding hazard such as falling rocks or annoying bird<br><br>
             Both character have a stamina bar that drains if the other character is not holding a rock, it drains even faster if they fall too low</p>

          <h2>Mechanics</h2>
          <p><br><br>Before a jump, you have a drag and drop mechanic to show the amount of power you want your jump to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
             The two characters are linked by an elastic rope, so you can't jump too far ahead, you can use it to do a bigger jump if one character is far behind. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
             You can also do a "dispair jump" in the air, it can be used to reajust or as a last ditch effort to grab a rock<br><br></p>

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>Concepts</h2>
          <p>The main structure of the idea was inspired by the classical age of mobile games with classics such as "Doodle Jump" or "Flappy bird". <br><br>
             The gameplay was mainly inspired by "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons" in which there is a climbing section with similar vibes.</p>

          <h2>Iterations</h2>
          <p>The iterations of the project were focuses on implementing basics mechanics. <br><br>
             1.Testing the concept : The idea is there, it worked in another game as a small mechanic, but can it be expanded as a whole game?<br><br>
             2.Adding stamina and the visuals for the rope : Iteration 1 was a test, but not giving any type of punishment for messing up a jump could result in the game never ending, so that's were the stamina came in, the rope itself serves to help visualize the link between the 2 characters. <br><br>
             3.Rock generation and score : This is when it started to be a game, now the players can climb forever, controls changed a few times, still testing what works better <br><br>
             4.Screens & UI : The game now has more to it and can be played with a purpose, now the player can launch and hold rocks, or let go at any points, this is how controls are done for now <br><br>
             5. Rework of controls and polishing : After more testing, the controls have been completely changed, as the holding mechanic just didn't feel that good, and the jumps were a bit random, you never knew where you headed, now you can decide before you jump, and you automatically grab on rock, making the jumps way more satisfying.</p>
