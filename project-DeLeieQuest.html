      <h1>De Leie Quest</h1>
      <p class="platform">Platform: 📱</p>

      <p>
        De Leie quest is a game that was made as a proof of concept for a client, it aims to distract children and make them learn about Kortrijk while having fun<br><br>
        The game aims to be a collection of games based on the location of the user, following their position on the GPS, like how pokemon go would work.
        The Proof of concept has only one polished game, as well as cutscenes and more, but more minigames have been iterated and could be added in a full version<br><br>
        Winning or collecting points will unlock cosmetic decorations for the player.

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>The current game has a simple gameplay loop, the tower in the middle is missing som cogs, you job is to get them to fix the tower, but they may be hidden, or worse, in the hands on the gnomes, in which case, you will need to poke them with your trusty goeiedag to make them drop their treasure.<br><br>
             You get also a currency when you poke the gnomes as the "spurs", the more you have, the more customization options you unlock</p>

          <h2>Mechanics</h2>
          <p>By default, you are roaming in the map, when you get a cog, you can't get another, only 1 at all time.<br><br>
             In order to win the game, you must place every cogs back on the tower, in the right place, in order to do that, you have an elevator that changes the gameplay.
             You now have the view of the side of the tower, and you can click on the missing spot to place your current cog. If everything is correct it will turn!</p>

          <h2>Concepts</h2>
          <p>The main idea of the game was mostly inspired by other games like pokemon go or monster hunter now. Each minigames was inspired by the history of the place as well as the location they take place in.<br><br>
             The tower minigame is inspired by the Belfry tower.</p>

          <h2>Iterations</h2>
          <p>The iterations were mostly about minigames ideas and play testing them<br><br>
             1.Canon Minigame : A minigame that took place next to the river, in which you would see boats coming toward you, you either needed to let them pass, or shoot the gnomes filled boats.<br><br>
             2.Cheese Wheel Golf : In this game, you simply had to push the cheese wheel at the finish line, gnome would have tried to stop you. This would take place in the beguinage<br><br>
             3.Repair the tower : This is the start of the tower minigame in the current game, in this, you simply had to pick up the cogs and place them on the tower, no gnomes to bother you yet<br><br>
             4.Poke the gnomes : This is the second part of the minigame, we choose to complexify the tower minigame with the gnomes to make it more challenging and more fun. This iteration was mostly about developping what would be the gnome AI later<br><br>
             5. Control readjustement : This is not a minigame, just an adjustement of the control, we wanted an approach of draging and dropping the cogs to place it on the tower, but navigating the level with this just felt terrible, so more iterations were made to correct and test better controls, until we came back to the idea of the prototype of the tower for carrying cogs, and the second type of gameplay for placing them</p>
